> Brian Carroll is a scoundrel. His paper should be run out of town. A committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.

I'm an art director living and working in the Los Angeles area with my wife and two cats.

I'm an illustrator and webcartoonist, starting in 2002, and known to some as the author of Instant Classic (launched 2003), Genrezvous Point (2004), and Two Party Opera (2016).

I'm also a filmmaker and a theatre-kid. My wife, Stephanie, and I cohosted a monthly play-reading circle focusing mostly on plays written before the mid-19th century, performed by actor and non-actor friends, alike.

Career-wise, if I made one of those cool grids of client logos that I've designed for, it would include Disney, Apple, Lucasfilm, Adobe, CNN, Microsoft, Steelcase, Bacardi, and many others. That's pretty neat.

I fail at NaNoWriMo every year. Someday I'll finish one.

I only played trumpet for about 3 years in my early teens but I still tell everyone I can play the trumpet.

During the pandemic, I discovered a love for printmaking out of my interest in typography. I'm still learning, but I'm having a blast.

I try to be as civic-minded as I can, serving on the Studio City Neighborhood Council for 3 years (2018-2021), including one year as its President. I ran for the House of Representatives in 2020 and got 3.5% in a crowded primary. 5984 votes and I love every one of them.

I was kicked out of Rochester Institutive of Technology in 2007 (it's a story that's way more interesting to me than it would be to anyone else), but re-enrolled 12 years later and now it's fun to say that I'm an RIT alumni, class of 2019.

I'll add more as they come to me.
